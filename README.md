# PUGXAutocompleterBundle

This bundle has a simple, specific purpose: adding an "autocomplete" (also known as "type-ahead")
field.
The typical use case is when you get a Many-to-One relation and you need to display a
form with related entity. If related entity has many thousands of items, using the
classic select is not suitable. Here comes this bundle.
